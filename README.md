## ðŸ“œ Main Information

Film Recommendations is a multilingual pet-project supporting English, Spanish,
German, Ukrainian, and Russian languages and was built using the API from themoviedb.org.

The project consists of:
- **Main Page.** On the main page users can see a list of films.
  Each film card includes: Poster, Title, Rating, Age category, Release date.
  If a user clicks on a film title, a page with detailed information about the film opens.
  Users can also add films to the 'Selected Films' section. Later they can name this list
  and share it with others. Following this link, the list of selected films will be opened.
  In addition, on the main page users can also use the filter that allows to specify certain
  parameters to search films. It's also possible to search films by title.

- **Genres Page.** This page displays film genres. Users can click on any genre, and they will see
  a list of films in that category.

- **Account.** Users can sign up or sign in if they already have an account.
  In the profile, they can edit personal information, see their list of selected films and delete
  their account. If users select films and then log into their account, the list of selected films
  will be fetched from the local storage, saved in the database and displayed in their profile.
